				<h2><b>Muhammad Ali Sadpara - Late </b> </h2>
				<p>(2 February 1976 – February 2021) was a Pakistani high-altitude mountaineer. He was part of the team (which included Italian alpinist Simone Moro) that successfully completed the first-ever winter ascent to the summit of Nanga Parbat in 2016. Sadpara was notable for having successfully climbed a grand total of eight eight-thousanders throughout his career—four of which he had ascended in a single calendar year.</p>

			<h2>Early life</h2>
			<p>
			Sadpara was born on 2 February 1976 in the village of Sadpara, located near Skardu in Gilgit−Baltistan, Pakistan to Fiza Sadpara.[citation needed] He was the youngest of eleven children, and eight of his siblings did not survive childhood. He married his wife, Fatima, when he was 19 and had his first son, Sajid, shortly afterwards; he had a total of three children. He completed his FA from a government college in Skardu and was a member of his college football team. He began his career as a high-altitude porter, serving as an assistant in mountain-climbing expeditions. Like most porters, Sadpara traversed the rugged Baltoro Glacier in flip-flops and castoff gear. His passion for mountaineering led to him becoming a successful mountaineer</p>

			<h2>K2 Summit-2021</h2>
			<p> Sadpara, along with his 21-year-old son, Sajid (who had also climbed K2 in 2019), teamed up with Icelandic mountaineer John Snorri Sigurjónsson and Chilean mountaineer Juan Pablo Mohr Priet for a joint-ascent of K2, and left the highest camp on the evening of 4 February 2021. <br> Sajid was later forced to descend due an oxygen regulator malfunction, leaving the other members of the team at the K2 Bottleneck, close to the summit. Sigurjónsson and Prieto continued their ascent to K2's summit, but did not return by night as planned, and were declared missing on 5 February 2021.<br> A rescue mission with two Pakistan Army helicopters was organized on 6 February 2021 to search for the team. On 18 February 2021, Pakistani authorities announced that the three men were officially presumed dead, but the search for their remains would continue. Sadpara's family also declared him as presumably dead on the same day.</p>
